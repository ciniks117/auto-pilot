# The task is to change the height from $0$~[m] to $1$~[m] within $5$~[s]. A goal region $[0.98,1.02]$ of the height $x_3$ has to be reached within $5$~[s] and the height has to stay below $1.4$ for all times. After $1$~[s] the height should stay above $0.9$~[m]. The initial position of the quadrotor is uncertain in all directions within $[-0.4,0.4]$~[m] and also the velocity is uncertain within $[-0.4,0.4]$~[m/s] for all directions. All other values are initialized as $0$.
